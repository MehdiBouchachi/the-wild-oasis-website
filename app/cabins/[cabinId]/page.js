// PLACEHOLDER DATA
/* export const metadata = {

// idea : we need to create this generateMetadata function to get the title of the page
export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  const cabin = await getCabin(params.cabinId);
  const { name } = cabin;

  return {
    title: `Cabin ${name}`,

export default async function Page({ params }) {

  // const settings = await getSettings();
  //const bookedDates = await getBookedDatesByCabinId(params.cabinId);

  // a problem here! the fetching of the data of getCabins is fetched in 2s and than the second one is fetched in 1s and the third one is fetched in 2s, why? bcz the second line has to wait ot finish the fetching of the getCabins than he will fetch and the third one aslo need to wait the second one which he's also waiting the first one and all of this will create a bad user experience bcz it has to take 5s to fetched all data , so we need to fetch all of them in the same time and we can do that by using Promise.all and we can do that by using the following code

  return (
    <div className="max-w-6xl mx-auto mt-8">
      <Cabin cabin={cabin} />
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-5xl font-semibold text-center mb-10 text-accent-400">
          Reserve {cabin.name} today. Pay on arrival.
        </h2>
      </div>
      <Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
        <Reservation cabin={cabin} />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
